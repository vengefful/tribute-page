    <h2>Here's a time line of Bill Gates:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1955</strong>: William Henry Gates III is born to attorney William Henry Gates
        II and Mary Gates, a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent and
        chairwoman of United Way International. He is raised in Seattle.</li>
      <li><strong>1967</strong>: Gates is enrolled in the Lakeside School, an exclusive private
        school in Seattle, where he befriends Paul Allen. The two students share
        an interest in computers and programming. The school notices his knack
        for technology and asks him to create a computerized schedule of classes.

          keynote speech at Lakeside School.</a></li>
      <li><strong>1973</strong>: Gates enters Harvard as a pre-law major, but soon shifts focus.
        He quickly runs through the university’s most rigorous mathematics and
        graduate level computer science courses.</li>
      <li><strong>1975</strong>: From his dorm room, Gates calls MITS, the maker of the world’s
        first personal computer. He offers to develop software for the MITS
        Altair. MITS eventually accepts and buys his language for $3,000 plus
        royalties. Gates takes his first leave of absence from school to start
        working on the software venture he refers to as Micro-Soft. </li>
      <li><strong>1976</strong>: Gates and Allen register the trademark “Microsoft.” Gates
        writes an open letter to computer hobbyists, condemning the early
        adopters for sharing, rather than paying for,
        software. <a

          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gates’ “Open Letter.”</a></li>
      <li><strong>1977</strong>: Gates takes a second leave of absence from Harvard and sets
        up Microsoft in Albuquerque, N.M., where MITS is headquartered.</li>
      <li><strong>1978</strong>: Microsoft’s year-end sales exceed $1 million. Gates gains
        reputation for being tough, but focused. </li>
      <li><strong>1979</strong>: Microsoft headquarters are relocated to Bellevue, Wash.,
        suburb of Gates’ hometown, Seattle.</li>
      <li><strong>1981</strong>: Microsoft incorporates and buys the rights to the operating
        system “DOS” from Seattle Computer Products. The system is modified
        and renamed MS-DOS, and the company licenses it to IBM for the
        Company’s new personal computer.</li>
      <li><strong>1983</strong>: Allen leaves Microsoft after developing Hodgkin’s disease.
        Microsoft announces Windows as an extension of its
        MS-DOS operating system.</li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong>: Microsoft headquarters move again, this time to nearby
        Redmond, Wash. Shortly after, the company goes public. </li>
      <li><strong>1987</strong>: At age 31, Gates becomes the youngest billionaire ever.
        He meets his future wife, Melinda French, at a
        Microsoft event in New York.</li>
      <li><strong>1989</strong>: Gates founds Corbis, an archive of art and photography
        from public and private collections. Corbis later becomes one of the
        largest collections of visual information in the world.</li>
      <li><strong>1990</strong>: The Federal Trade Commission begins an investigation into
        possible collusion between IBM and Microsoft.The FTC charges that IBM
        and Microsoft collaborated to divvy up the market for operating systems
        in an anticompetitive way, with IBM’s OS/2 capturing the high-end of
        the market and Microsoft’s Windows covering the low-end of the market.</li>
      <li><strong>1994:</strong> Gates weds French; the couple goes on to have three children.
        The Gateses consolidate their charitable giving under the William H.
        Gates Foundation, named for Gates’ father, who agrees to manage the
        foundation. It is later absorbed into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.</li>
      <li><strong>1995</strong>: In July, at age 39 and with a fortune of $12.9 billion, Gates
        becomes the world’s richest man. Later that summer, Microsoft introduces
        Internet Explorer to the world, as part of Windows 95. The Road Ahead,
        Gates’ book about his vision for the digital future, holds the No.
        1 spot on The New York Times best-seller list for seven weeks.
        Gates begins to shift Microsoft’s focus toward the emerging Internet.</li>
      <li><strong>1998</strong>: In Belgium, on his way to meet business and government leaders,
        Gates is hit in the face with a cream pie. The incident was orchestrated
        by Noel Godin, a Belgian who gained notoriety for throwing pies at
        high-profile individuals. Godin was quoted saying the incident was an act
        “against hierarchical power.” In May, the U.S. Justice Department charges
        Microsoft with engaging in anticompetitive and exclusionary practices
        designed to maintain its monopoly in personal computer operating systems
        and to extend that monopoly to Internet browsing software. Twenty state
        attorneys general and the District of Columbia filed a similar action.
        Later, in October the DOJ also sued Microsoft for violating a 1994 consent
        decree, by forcing computer makers to include its Internet browser as a
        part of the installation of Windows software.</li>
      <li><strong>1999</strong>: Gates publishes another best-selling book, Business @ the Speed of
        Thought, about the interconnectedness of business and technology. That
        year he begins appearing more and more in pop culture. The television network
        TNT airs a made-for-TV movie about the emergence of Apple and Microsoft called
        Pirates of Silicon Valley. Anthony Michael Hall, who played the nerd Brian in
        The Breakfast Club, plays Gates. </li>
      <li><strong>2000</strong>: Gates steps down as CEO of Microsoft. Gates’ former Harvard dorm-mate
        and right-hand man Steve Ballmer takes over the helm, while Gates becomes
        chief software architect. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is formed,
        merging the William H. Gates Foundation and the Gates Learning Foundation.
        Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson concludes Microsoft misused
        its monopoly power, and orders the company be split in twoparts, one to
        produce the operating system and the other to produce
        other software components. More</li>
